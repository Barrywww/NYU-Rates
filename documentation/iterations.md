## Iteration 1: Proposal ✅
We wrote the proposal together as a team, thought of the project that we were going to be working on for the entire semester. A lot of ideas were generated, at last we picked the NYU Rates, and enumerated some of the possible aspects and functionalities it could cover. Each of us wrote one part of the project proposal.

## Iteration 2: Use Cases ✅ 
We mainly discussed the different use cases in our projects and drew the use case diagram. Through this process, we tried to come up with all the possible scenarios of the users. Based on all the scenarios and the use cases, we were divided into two groups and each group chose one use case to write the detailed description. 

## Iteration 3: Class Diagram ✅ 
 We mainly revisited and discussed  designing the class diagram and kept previous use cases since no additional use cases are identified. Then we divided into two pairs to draw respectively UML sequence diagrams for the selected use case. We started to build the framework of the front end for the project. 

## Iteration 4: Basic Implementations [...]
The front-end members continue to develop user-side pages while the back-end members discuss and nail down and document required APIs. Finish database set-up(MySQL) and finish user-side API development(SpringBoot). Insert test data to database.

## Iteration 5: Front & Back Integration ⭕️
Front-end: Coin all the components and their interconnection as well as the design and layout of different interfaces. Hopefully finish up the primal fundamental framework of the entire project. 
Back-end: Finish backend API development. Start considering test cases.

## Iteration 6: Testing Phase ⭕️
We will finish the whole structure of our project before Iteration 6. The rest of the work would be debugging and unit testing.We apply different unit test cases to check whether our application is stable and usable. 
We’ll work on the final presentation as well, and will see then who shall be responsible for which part.

And finally, Kaan,Max,Barry and Joseph are responsible for spending some time appreciating what we have done. Cheers! :)
